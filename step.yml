      title: "Ignore Paths from change check"
      summary: "Ignore these Paths when checking for cache changes"
      description: |-
        These paths will be ignored from change checking.
        If something changed under the specified path(s) and nothing else changed
        then the cache won't be updated.

        **These paths are NOT ignored from the cache**, if a path is located
        inside a specified Cache Path item it'll be included in the cache,
        just won't be checked for changes.

        Important: you can't ignore a path which results in an invalid cache item.
        For example, if you specify the path `a/path/to/cache` to be cached, you
        can't ignore `a/path/to`, as that would ignore every file from checking
        for a change - no fingerprint could be generated for `a/path/to/cache`.
        You're free to ignore paths inside a Cache Path however, e.g.
        if path is `a/path/to/cache` you're free to ignore `a/path/to/cache/.ignore-me`,
        unless that's the only file inside `a/path/to/cache`.

        The point is: you should not specify an ignore rule which would completely
        ignore a specified Cache Path item, as that would result in a path which
        can't be checked for updates/changes/fingerprints.
